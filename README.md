## W5

### Activity 1 
I like how the Use of IBreakable and Item class have alot of potiental to be modified between each item. However, i feel like rewritting the damage class is redudant and will become grueling to reimpliment. I would make the item class calculate damage and make it virtual, so if the item did not need it to be edited it can stay, or be edited by the programmer.

### Activity 2
For the Model, the EnemyStats and ItemW5Demo2 scripts hold all the information about the certain items and enemy interactions for the game to use. For the View element of the demo, the InventoryUI and DialogueBubble scripts all display the backend code running. For the Controller element for the demo, The PlayerW5Demo2 class and EnemyW5Demo2 both manage the movement and proximity systems that will display the dialogue bubbles. 

### Activity 3
Scenario 1:
- Mvc
    - seperate the data for points gained and note speed and whatnot (Model)
    - Sprites and UI as well as visual Indicators (View)
    - Carries out how the notes move and how the player interacts with them (Controller)

Scenario 2:
- MVC
    - Player, points, money, and stats for weapons and abilites (Model)
    - UI, scoreboard, and other visual results of the game (View)
    - Carrying out use of abilites, damage players, creating sheilds (Controller)

Scenario 3:
- State machine
    - Player has several states for running, planting, trading, and several other parts of the game that can have seperate states
    - Animations can be tied to the states to make it easier for programmer
